You also know that, along with Portugal, Spain is a peninsula, which means that it is a landmass surrounded on three sides by water. In this chapter, we'll take a more in-depth look into some of those and other interesting geographical facts about Spain. It is important to know that geography concerns, not just landmasses and population distribution, but also climate, weather, politics, and culture.

If you haven't seen the film, it is one of the signature lines spoken by the main character, Conan, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in his breakout role.\nThe film is shot in several exotic and diverse locales, ranging from deserts to forests and alpine regions. Although the film overwhelmingly stars Americans, was directed by American John Milius, and was written by American Oliver Stone, it was shot almost entirely in Spain.\nOriginally scheduled to be shot in Yugoslavia, the film production was moved to Spain due to costs and the possibility of political instability in Yugoslavia. Production headquarters were set up in Madrid, which is also where a set was created.", "file_url": "Spanish History/The_Great_Book_of_Spain__Interesting_Stories,_Spanish.pdf#page=113"}

The two quintessential Spanish alcoholic beverages that are consumed all over the world, however, are sangria and sherry.\n112 Sangria is a dark red wine, which is how it got its name-sangra is the Spanish word for \"blood.\" What makes sangria different from other wines around the world, though, is that it is served with chunks of fruit or even orange juice mixed inside it. The chunks of fruit or juice give the wine a sugary-and for many, more palatable-taste. As mentioned earlier in this book, wine production has a long history in Spain going back to ancient times, but it is not known exactly when sangria originated.\nBy the early 20th century, in addition to within Spain, iced sangria became popular in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and some other Latin American countries, eventually making its way north of the border to the United States.\nSpain's other famous alcoholic drink, sherry, is thought of by many as being an English drink since the English enjoy having a sherry during their teatime/happy hour. But the origins of sherry are firmly in Spain during the Middle Ages.\nSherry is a fortified wine made from green grapes. It was originally made in the Jerez, Andalusia, which the Muslims knew as \"Sherish,\" during the early Islamic occupation of Spain.

The two quintessential Spanish alcoholic beverages that are consumed all over the world, however, are sangria and sherry.\n112 Sangria is a dark red wine, which is how it got its name-sangra is the Spanish word for \"blood.\" What makes sangria different from other wines around the world, though, is that it is served with chunks of fruit or even orange juice mixed inside it. The chunks of fruit or juice give the wine a sugary-and for many, more palatable-taste. As mentioned earlier in this book, wine production has a long history in Spain going back to ancient times, but it is not known exactly when sangria originated.\nBy the early 20th century, in addition to within Spain, iced sangria became popular in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and some other Latin American countries, eventually making its way north of the border to the United States.\nSpain's other famous alcoholic drink, sherry, is thought of by many as being an English drink since the English enjoy having a sherry during their teatime/happy hour.

There\n160 have been numerous reports of spectral activity in the president's office, ranging from doors opening and closing, seemingly by themselves, to sightings of shadow-like apparitions.\nSkeptics dismiss the activity at the university as a combination of overactive imaginations and the fabled winds of La Mancha. But not everyone is so quick to write off a possible otherworldly explanation for the scary activity at the University of Castilla-La Mancha.\nIt seems the only way to know for sure may be to take a trip there yourself.\nA Dead Species Reborn?\nRemember way back in Chapter 3 when we discussed some of Spain's native animals? One of those species, the Pyrenean ibex, became extinct in 2000. The loss left biologists and conservations frustrated, but a group of geneticists came up with a revolutionary answer to the loss-create a clone.
