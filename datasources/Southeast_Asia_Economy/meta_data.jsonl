Rather, a thematic approach better captures the way that local, national developments are ultimately intertwined with regional and global ones, helping us to recognise both commonalities across societies and their shared causes.\nAccordingly, this volume is divided into four parts. Part I, Southeast Asia's Political Economy: Theory and Historical Evolution, comprises two chapters: the first details competing theorisations of Southeast Asian polit- ical economy and explains the Murdoch School approach we use in this book; the second presents an overview of Southeast Asia's economic development from independence to hyperglobalisation. These chapters set up the wider theoretical and historical-sociological context for the rest of the volume. Part II-Economic Development and Governance-explores the main trends in economic and political governance across the region, discussing ", "file_url": "Southeast_Asia_Economy/The_Political_Economy_of_Southeast_Asia__Politics_and_Uneven.pdf#page=9"}

This withdrawal and expenditure of funds has a significant impact on economic activity. Moreover, Southeast Asian states have taken a major role in guiding and producing economic development, a fact grudgingly recognised even by organisations typically hostile to eco- nomic interference by the state, such as the World Bank (1993, 1997, 2002).\nOn the other hand, the reverse is also true: the economy strongly influ- ences political conflict and decision-making. At the most basic level, states survive because they tax economic activity. If the economy falters, the state itself is in trouble.

This withdrawal and expenditure of funds has a significant impact on economic activity. Moreover, Southeast Asian states have taken a major role in guiding and producing economic development, a fact grudgingly recognised even by organisations typically hostile to eco- nomic interference by the state, such as the World Bank (1993, 1997, 2002).\nOn the other hand, the reverse is also true: the economy strongly influ- ences political conflict and decision-making.

As early critics of the 1980s Weberian revival pointed out, efforts to empirically identify the exact demarcation between a state and its society always fail (Cammack 1989: 267-269; Jessop 1990: 287). On close inspection, the boundaries actually appear \"elusive, porous, and mobile\", with state officials enjoying close political, economic, personal or other relations with particular social groups (Mitchell 1991: 77).

On the one hand, Indonesia's capitalist development has generated new social groups and created new contradictions, leading to the emergence of new forms of opposition to established power-holders, such as civil society organisations and Islamist groupings critical of corruption and cronyism. When the AFC shook the Suharto regime, these groups mobilised to push for change. Crucially, the oligarchy also split, with some key politico-business elites concluding that Suharto could no longer secure their material interests.

Although liberal reformers struggled for more thoroughgoing change, their relative weakness after decades of repression meant that they lacked a solid social base and the organisational capacity to successfully exploit the AFC.

On the one hand, Indonesia's capitalist development has generated new social groups and created new contradictions, leading to the emergence of new forms of opposition to established power-holders, such as civil society organisations and Islamist groupings critical of corruption and cronyism. When the AFC shook the Suharto regime, these groups mobilised to push for change. Crucially, the oligarchy also split, with some key politico-business elites concluding that Suharto could no longer secure their material interests.

The increasingly hot Cold War drove powerful states to buy up necessary strategic commodi- ties, sending prices surging: tin prices increased 400% and rubber prices rose by 200%. This commodity boom was particularly crucial for Indonesia, Malaya and Singapore (the latter as a key trader and entrep\u00f4t), but also mattered for Thailand and Vietnam. For example, the economy of colo- nial Malaya was described as \"entirely dependent on rubber and tin\", with over a third of the workforce connected in some way to rubber production (ibid .: 521). Importantly, rather than being used for the purchase of for- eign manufactures, British-imposed import restrictions meant that much more of the surpluses generated from commodity exports remained in the territories than might have otherwise been the case.", "file_url": "Southeast_Asia_Economy/The_Political_Economy_of_Southeast_Asia__Politics_and_Uneven.pdf#page=66"}

Post-war \"social compacts\" between capital and labour were torn up, with labour unions crushed, corporatist state institutions dismantled, and states reconfigured in rela- tion to global competitiveness, rather than national development (Ruggie 1982).\nThis crisis and its outcome had variable and evolving effects on Southeast Asia. Initially, the region experienced very negative impacts, compounding the withering of gains from Cold War conflict as the Indochina Wars wound down.

Contemporary development pol- icy, now almost completely delinked from the sorts of substantive develop- ment processes evident in the post-war era, focuses upon the often modest gains possible from improvements in governance and further public-pri- vate partnerships-the main method made responsible for delivering on infrastructure to further support growth-within the ostensibly inevitable context of the world market.\nIt was not always thus. In the post-war/pre-neoliberal period, policy- makers, politicians, scholars and revolutionaries struggled over the poten- tial of different development strategies, as part of \"hot\" and \"cold\" conflicts.

Both countries experienced popular uprisings, spurring transitions from authoritarian to democratic political systems.

Mining has been environmentally and socially unsustainable, with profits appropriated by elites (World Bank 2017a), and profoundly negative social, livelihoods and health impacts for the poor (Keovilignavong and Suhardiman 2018; see also Hatcher, this 120\nC.

The CPP has done so without abandoning armed struggle. CPP-aligned, open, legal parties have regularly managed to secure six to eight seats in the lower house of Congress through a \"party list\" system for \"marginalised\" sectors.

Unfortunately, however, this involves competing in electoral regimes that have typically been crafted by, and remain dominated by, entrenched politico-economic elites.\nWith the exception of the CPP, Southeast Asia's Maoist groups have failed to make the transition into electoral politics. The CPP has done so without abandoning armed struggle. CPP-aligned, open, legal parties have regularly managed to secure six to eight seats in the lower house of Congress through a \"party list\" system for \"marginalised\" sectors. But because the CPP's primary aim remains the revolutionary overthrow of the state, rather than participation in \"bourgeois\" governance, it engages in elections only for tactical or instrumental reasons, and has not made further progress in electoral politics.\nMore broadly, contending with entrenched elites in the electoral arena has posed a formidable challenge for democratic left groups in Southeast Asia. This is partly because the balance of forces is profoundly unpromis- ing: workers and peasants demobilised, left forces crushed, and oligarchic elements ascendant. This context allows entrenched socio-political elites to shape the contours of contemporary political participation.

Such conditions easily gave rise to ideas that eco- nomic advances served only a tiny elite, while most remained vulnerable to poverty, thus providing fertile ground once again for populist stirrings.\nHOW CROSS-CLASS ALLIANCES AND POPULIST MOVEMENTS ARE PRESERVING OR REORDERING CLASS POWER AND WEALTH IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\nIn all of these cases, widespread dissatisfaction with economic and political governance-fundamentally underpinned by the consolidation of neolib- eral policy sets (see Carroll, this volume)-enabled the rise of cross-class alliances between forces from below and established elite interests.", "file_url": "Southeast_Asia_Economy/The_Political_Economy_of_Southeast_Asia__Politics_and_Uneven.pdf#page=184"}

He offered a solution to ongoing fears of chaos and crimi- nality that political liberals like Aquino III had been unable to deal with.\nThere is little evidence, however, that Duterte has undertaken policies that threaten, fundamentally, the oligarchic families and their corporate cronies or made headway against predatory behaviour, including in land- grabbing or the use of extra-legal coercion against opponents. While an alliance has now transpired between the Duterte, Macapagal-Arroyo and Marcos clans (Cook 2018), his links with leftists have weakened, with some now seeing him as the number one enemy of the people (Sison 2018). Unsurprisingly, we have not seen the sort of moves against him from within the elites that Thaksin had elicited in Thailand.\nCONCLUSION: IS SOUTHEAST ASIAN POPULISM REFORMIST OR REACTIONARY?\nEven when in power, populist leaders cannot afford to dispense with their tenuous cross-class bases of social support. They must fulfil at least some promises.

In this context, both fractions of capital and the state have been pressured to adopt market-conforming behaviours, further intensifying patterns of global capitalist relations.\nCrucially, the growing domination of this internationalising fraction of capital, particularly since the 1980s, does not imply that the state becomes less important, as suggested by some scholars of the \"transnational capital- ist class\" (e.g., Robinson 2007; Sklair 2001). On the contrary, its role has become more crucial to ensure the process of internationalisation of this interior bourgeoisie (Poulantzas 1974).

In this context, both fractions of capital and the state have been pressured to adopt market-conforming behaviours, further intensifying patterns of global capitalist relations.\nCrucially, the growing domination of this internationalising fraction of capital, particularly since the 1980s, does not imply that the state becomes less important, as suggested by some scholars of the \"transnational capital- ist class\" (e.g., Robinson 2007; Sklair 2001).

The cohesion between the state and capital, supported through the formation of political institutions and government policies, has pushed economic and political governance in Singapore in a direction that is nei- ther liberal nor democratic (see Rodan and Baker, this volume).

The cohesion between the state and capital, supported through the formation of political institutions and government policies, has pushed economic and political governance in Singapore in a direction that is nei- ther liberal nor democratic (see Rodan and Baker, this volume).

This is not surprising in view of the unchanging nature of the analytical object: ASEAN's lack of institutional evolution, and most member states' reluctance to touch upon the sensitive issue of national sovereignty, make it difficult for students of ASEAN to add any new and original findings to the debate (Dosch 2006: 164).\nWhile this complaint is refreshingly frank, its substance is typical. Mainstream International Relations (IR) scholars may differ over which theoretical lens to use in assessing regional organisations, but they generally agree that, in Southeast Asia, these institutions are weak, because states stubbornly refuse to relinquish their sovereignty to the supranational bodies supposedly required to solve regional problems (cf. Jones 2012).\nThis perspective ignores evidence that Southeast Asian states have com- promised their sovereignty in many important ways, such as through membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or interventions by the international financial institutions (IFIs).

Fundamentally, this is a product of the transformation of statehood (Al-Fadhat, this volume), underpinned by the transnationalisation of economic flows (Carroll, this volume). The fragmentation of state authority, coupled with a need to enhance and regulate transnational flows, has led to the formation of new governance networks. These are often issue-specific, with memberships that cut across established regional organisations, and are often linked to other, non-regional entities like the IFIs, helping to impose their disciplines. They operate not by establishing supranational authorities empowered to manage issues directly, but by defining rules and regulations that should be enacted in domestic governance; participating state agencies are expected to domesticate these regulations, thereby imposing international disciplines on their states and societies. This approach has been dubbed \"regulatory regionalism\" (Jayasuriya 2008; see also Hameiri and Jayasuriya 2011). In this mode of governance, contestation does not involve battles between proponents 202 L. JONES AND S.

Fundamentally, this is a product of the transformation of statehood (Al-Fadhat, this volume), underpinned by the transnationalisation of economic flows (Carroll, this volume). The fragmentation of state authority, coupled with a need to enhance and regulate transnational flows, has led to the formation of new governance networks. These are often issue-specific, with memberships that cut across established regional organisations, and are often linked to other, non-regional entities like the IFIs, helping to impose their disciplines. They operate not by establishing supranational authorities empowered to manage issues directly, but by defining rules and regulations that should be enacted in domestic governance; participating state agencies are expected to domesticate these regulations, thereby imposing international disciplines on their states and societies. This approach has been dubbed \"regulatory regionalism\" (Jayasuriya 2008; see also Hameiri and Jayasuriya 2011).

However, most scholars lament the poverty of regional responses, blaming member-states' refusal to surrender sovereignty to ASEAN. By shifting our focus to regulatory regionalism, we can see that much more is being done than these accounts suggest.\nThe case of anti-money-laundering (AML) regulation is instructive.

However, AMRO's objectives are certainly reinforced by governments' desire to maintain market lending credibility and attract foreign investment (see Carroll, this volume).\nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering\nSoutheast Asia is often seen to be plagued by non-traditional security (NTS) problems: non-military threats that easily traverse state borders, like environmental degradation, epidemics, terrorism and organised crime. However, most scholars lament the poverty of regional responses, blaming member-states' refusal to surrender sovereignty to ASEAN. By shifting our focus to regulatory regionalism, we can see that much more is being done than these accounts suggest.\nThe case of anti-money-laundering (AML) regulation is instructive.

Likewise, ERIA (2012) noted that NTBs remained significant; trade and investment facilitation was limited; no regional infrastructure projects were on track; and regional regulations were frequently either not being translated into domestic rules or not being properly enforced.\nIndeed, rather than simply implementing the AEC's liberalising agenda, domestic power-holders can resist or even reverse liberalisation. This may be exacerbated by the fragmentation and decentralisation of state appara- tuses. For example, in Indonesia, while the national government has tried to cascade AEC planning downwards, local governments have resisted, using their regulatory powers to protect local clients (Lele 2018). Resistance to liberalisation is starkly reflected in the rapid growth of NTBs under the AEC-the exact opposite of what was intended (see Fig. 8.2).

Likewise, ERIA (2012) noted that NTBs remained significant; trade and investment facilitation was limited; no regional infrastructure projects were on track; and regional regulations were frequently either not being translated into domestic rules or not being properly enforced.\nIndeed, rather than simply implementing the AEC's liberalising agenda, domestic power-holders can resist or even reverse liberalisation. This may be exacerbated by the fragmentation and decentralisation of state appara- tuses.

Rather, it is also accompanied by a decline in the terms and conditions of employment, e.g. reductions in wages and lower levels of unionisation, in the sectors con- cerned (Standing 1989, 1999). The emergence of \"feminised\" work is thus a comment on the nature of the work itself-\"flexible\" (i.e. easy to hire and fire), feminised workforces employed in tightly controlled, inten- sive manufacturing work where there is little scope for resistance to these labour practices.\nAlthough the feminisation of labour is a global trend, local socio- economic contexts shape its specific form in Southeast Asia.", "file_url": "Southeast_Asia_Economy/The_Political_Economy_of_Southeast_Asia__Politics_and_Uneven.pdf#page=251"}

Host states, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, have steadfastly rejected any notion of a legally-binding instrument, a long-standing demand of the Philippines. When Manila 262\nK. GERARD AND C. S.

However, the strong influence of private sector interests over public policy and the subsequent trajectory of the MRAs suggests the AQRF will also be designed and 10 LABOUR MIGRATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 267\nimplemented unevenly, with outcomes determined ", "file_url": "Southeast_Asia_Economy/The_Political_Economy_of_Southeast_Asia__Politics_and_Uneven.pdf#page=284"}

First, labour migration in the region has been profoundly shaped by historical state and industrial trans- formations. With respect to low-wage migration, weak welfare provisions and the commercialisation of land rights have created a large surplus labour force with limited livelihood opportunities. Simultaneously, labour- intensive industries seeking to be globally competitive, or simply to sur- vive, generated demand for a flexible, low-wage workforce. With respect to high-wage migration, regimes have been designed to favour specific state projects and agendas, whether to raise state capital or support par- ticular professions.\nSecond, given the private sector's high degree of influence over public policy across the region, which stems from historical processes of state-led development, the governance of migration has been determined by policy- makers in close consultation with employers in key economic sectors. The regulations that have emerged are both explicit, such as memorandums of understanding between individual countries, and implicit, such as sporadic crackdowns on undocumented migrant workers.", "content": " However, the strong influence of private sector interests over public policy and the subsequent trajectory of the MRAs suggests the AQRF will also be designed and 10 LABOUR MIGRATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 267\nimplemented unevenly, with outcomes determined by whether the rele- vant national education and professional bodies have an interest in sup- porting the regional recognition of qualifications.\nCONCLUSION\nBy analysing how labour migration is governed in Southeast Asia, this chapter has presented three arguments.

This is readily evident in cities throughout Southeast Asia, from the appropriation of state- or privately-owned land for liveli- hood generation by street vendors, to sprawling informal settlements that make use of any available empty land. In Jakarta and Metro Manila, around 30% of the population are informal residents.\nTypically, quiet encroachment involves avoidance of authorities; how- ever, once having secured their place, street vendors and informal settlers will seek degrees of protection from more powerful actors through pay- ment of rents and or bribes to grease toleration and exclude others (Bayat 1997: 135). In Jakarta, Simone (2015) explains how encroachments into public space by the poor are \"sorted out\" by \"unofficial authorities\"- state officials acting outside their authority, and local \"bossmen\".

This is readily evident in cities throughout Southeast Asia, from the appropriation of state- or privately-owned land for liveli- hood generation by street vendors, to sprawling informal settlements that make use of any available empty land. In Jakarta and Metro Manila, around 30% of the population are informal residents.\nTypically, quiet encroachment involves avoidance of authorities; how- ever, once having secured their place, street vendors and informal settlers will seek degrees of protection from more powerful actors through pay- ment of rents and or bribes to grease toleration and exclude others (Bayat 1997: 135). In Jakarta, Simone (2015) explains how encroachments into public space by the poor are \"sorted out\" by \"unofficial authorities\"- state officials acting outside their authority, and local \"bossmen\".

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have become increasingly prosperous, making it difficult for traditional donors to justify large amounts of aid to these countries on poverty-related grounds; fiscal difficulties in traditional donor countries in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008 have led in some cases to cuts in aid budgets, and efforts by donors to focus their aid on priority countries; and some Southeast Asian countries have sought to reduce their dependence on aid from traditional donors and limit these donors' influence over their policies.", "content": "1 At the same time, some recent innovations in aid research-most notably the creation of the AidData database-have gone some way towards addressing data gaps for emerging donors, at least in relation to Chinese aid.

Modes of governance in extractive industries reflect a combination of domestic politics extending well beyond formal institutions and the manner in which these combine with global capitalist processes (such as particular patterns of growth and the attendant demand for commodities) and wider geopolitical power relations (see Hameiri and Jones, this volume).\nThe following section presents a brief overview of extractive industries in Southeast Asia, followed by an explanation of how the sector's modes of governance have been shaped over the course of the past decades by evolving struggles for power and resources both locally and within the wider global political economy.\nINTERNATIONAL CAPITAL, NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGIME CONSOLIDATION\nIn 2014, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for more than half of the world's total production of metal ore and metals.

According to the Extractive Industries Review (EIR 2003: 10), in the 1990s, no fewer than 100 countries underwent reforms in line with the World Bank's advice. Out of the 1097 changes in national foreign direct investments (FDI) laws adopted between 1992 and 2000 alone, 94% created a more favourable investment climate (MIGA 2010, cited in Hatcher 2014).\nThese reforms were spearheaded by a discourse that championed-and legitimised-a development model driven by resource extraction.

(1998: 77) noted:\nExploration investment in Asia lags [behind] that in most other regions, and while expenditures have increased in the 1990s, the rate of increase lags [behind] that of Australia, South America and Africa. Political, legal, and fiscal uncertainties or barriers, in some cases, effectively make private explo- ration and mining investment difficult.\nCrucially, by the end of the 1990s, under the guidance of IFIs (mostly the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank-ADB), resource-rich countries began reforming their mining sectors, a process that embedded new competitive pressures within global extractive sectors, setting country against country, and compelling further patterns of liberalisation (Campbell 2009; Hatcher 2014). According to the Extractive Industries Review (EIR 2003: 10), in the 1990s, no fewer than 100 countries underwent reforms in line with the World Bank's advice. Out of the 1097 changes in national foreign direct investments (FDI) laws adopted between 1992 and 2000 alone, 94% created a more favourable investment climate (MIGA 2010, cited in Hatcher 2014).\nThese reforms were spearheaded by a discourse that championed-and legitimised-a development model driven by resource extraction.

Similarly, Thailand's Mitr Phol Group began as a sugar supplier before working its way upstream through sugar milling to ownership of sugar plantations in Laos, Cambodia, Australia and elsewhere.\nThe regional investment boom has been led by several crops, most notably palm oil and rubber, though cassava, maize, sugar and even the traditional staple, rice, are also highly significant (see Fig. 14.1). Cassava and maize are largely geared toward producing feed for European, Japanese and Chinese livestock industries, while the boom in rubber has overwhelmingly been led by industrial-mainly automotive-demand from China.
